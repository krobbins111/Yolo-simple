# Yolo
This project will implement yolo using darknet and a pre-trained coco model.
I will create the model structure, load the coco weights into the format of my yolo model, and run detection on input images.



anchors and params

model
- feature extraction with darknet
- convolution layers
- detection layers
- output layer with bounding box coordinates

non max suppression

detection? (picking and drawing boxes with label)
